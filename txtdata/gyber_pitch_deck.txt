Problem Statement
Many people today have difficulty
accessing basic services because of
outdated systems and limited resources.
Health care is often expensive and
inaccessible, especially for people in
rural areas or developing countries.
Traditional models of education ignore
individual needs, leading to frustration
and lack of skills. Resources are often
allocated inefficiently, perpetuating
inequalities and excluding marginalized
communities.
AiC Division (Artificial
Intelligence and Blockchain
Community)
The AiC project is a revolutionary fusion
of artificial intelligence and blockchain
technology. We aim to create an open
community for the development and use
of AI models in a blockchain
environment. The use of DAO contracts
provides transparency and openness in
the development and use of these
models. AiC is driving progress in areas
such as medicine, finance,
transportation, and many others by
offering minimal costs and improved
security and transparency of processes.
Gyber Experiment and
Macroeconomic Dao
Gyber Experiment is an initiative that
combines cryptography, computer
science, sociology and economics to
create a cyber social corporation.
Experiment is based on the Gyber Social
Platform, a social network managed by
users through a decentralized
autonomous organization (DAO). This
platform not only provides basic social
network functions, but also emphasizes
data security by offering multiple layers
of data protection, including client-side
or server-side encryption.
Deseo
Developing a technology
architecture and data
security system
We are in the process of designing and
developing the Gyber platform, which
will feature an open and scalable
architecture. We plan to implement
innovative data security techniques,
including multiple layers of encryption
on both the client and server side to
maximize privacy and security of
information in the future.
Gyber ecosystem: DAO,
Tokenomics and participant
interaction
DAOs (decentralized autonomous
organizations), tokenomics and
participant interaction play a key role in
the Gyber ecosystem. DAOs provide
transparent and democratic
governance, tokenomics defines the
economic structure and motivation, and
participant interactions facilitate
collaboration and knowledge sharing.
This complex network of interactions
forms the basis for efficient operation
and community growth.
